          Hello and welcome to my GitHub website, my name is Jordan McIntyre and I am a student at John Abbott College. 
          I'm a programmer always looking for a challenge, and thus found problem solving to be a really interesting flavor of programming.
          I don't like to limit myself to just one language, so you may see my work in languages like C, C#, Haskell, Python and more. 
          The different tools a language may offer can make problems easier or harder depending on the language. Learning about what's efficient and when has been really interesting.

        I wasn't really sure what path I wanted to pursue but then I ended up finding programming, and at first I 
        struggled pretty hard with some small stuff but after it clicked it became fun, and the struggling helped as lessons. 
        Through problem solving I've come across and learned about these different algorithms that are interesting and cool to use. 
        For example Prime numbers can be quickly generated with a Sieve of Eratosthenes.

      <p>
        Implementing these different algorithms to solve problems has been fun, and I look forward to learning and exploring more areas in programming and Computer Sciences in general. 
        By following the few links int the navigation bar above you can find the various things I've worked on during the few
        years I've been programming. If you'd like to inquire about more, feel free to contact me through one of my options below.
