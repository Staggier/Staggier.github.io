            Welcome to my GitHub website, on here you will be able to find various solutions to Project Euler problems and some schoolwork.

          Some of my personal favorite solutions (that are posted) come from these problems:

            <a href="https://github.com/Staggier/ProjectEuler/blob/master/PE%23012.cs">#12: Highly divisible triangular number</a>
            <p>
              This problem covers finding the first triangle number that contains over 500 divisors.

            <a href="https://github.com/Staggier/ProjectEuler/blob/master/PE%23015.rkt">#15: Lattice paths</a>
            <p>
              This problem covers finding the possible paths in a 20 x 20 grid where you can only move down or right
              one block. The solution I came up with was first taught in the now removed Math course in the Computer Science
              420-A0 Program.

            <a href="https://github.com/Staggier/ProjectEuler/blob/master/PE%23067.cs">#67: Maximum Path Sum II</a>
            <p>
              This problem covers finding the max sum of the paths in a triangle shaped 'grid', my solution comes from
              grouping the highest values starting from the bottom rather than the top.

            <p>
              This problem covers manually calculating square roots (unless you're using some powerfull language like Haskell) to
              find the first 100 decimal places of all irrational square roots from 1-100.

            <p>
              This problem covers Sudoku, this one was a fun problem to solve.
