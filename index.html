        Welcome to my portfolio website, here you can learn about and see what interests me as a Computer Science student. I like
        to spend my time programming, a lot of my enjoyment comes from problem solving after all! I'm starting to warm up to web
        programming and like most people I've been interested in doing gamedev work as well.

          I practice my studies at John Abbott College, and have learned many different aspects to Computer Science that are very
          interesting to me. A topic that sticks out even now is data manipulation, I find that using an object's data for many
          different things interesting; Simplicity to convey the complex.

      The computer science field is full of interesting topics and sadly there isn't enough time to cover everything, but I always
      try to keep learning something new when I can. It's important to keep your mind fresh and swimming with new ideas.
