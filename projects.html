        <p> In this section I will highlight four problems from <a href="https://www.projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> that
            I've solved and found interesting. In reality there are a lot more that are interesting to me, but I'll limit myself to 
            four problems.</p>
        <div>
            <h3> Project Euler #15: Lattice Paths</h3>
            <img src="assets/LatticePaths.png" srcset="assets/LatticePaths.png 598w, assets/LP449W.png 449w, assets/LP299W.png 299w" alt="Visual Aid for problem description">
            <p>
                This problem covers solving for the amount of paths in a 20x20 grid where you start from the top left and end
                in the bottom right. This one was interesting because the most optimal solution was actually taught in the now
                removed Math course that was offered in the Computer Science 420-AO program at John Abbott College. It can be
                solved simply with the equation n Choose r. Which if you remember is (factorial n) / ((factorial r) * (factorial (n - r))).

            <h3> Project Euler #59: XOR Decryption</h3>

            <p>
                This problem covers solving for a 3 character long key and decrypting the given message with it, and then calculating the
                sum of the ASCII values of the original message. This problem was interesting because shortly after completion the topic of
                decrypting was further covered in my IT class. If I recall correctly I solved this problem by going through the text with a
                possible key and matching the created strings to a dictionary of common english words and took the result with the highest amount
                of matched words.

            <h3> Project Euler #72: Counting Fractions</h3>
            <img src="assets/PE072.PNG" srcset="assets/PE072.PNG 1012w, assets/PE072759W 759w, assets/PE072506W 506w">
            <p>
                This problem covers finding all distinct fractions k/n from where 2 <= k < n and 2 <= n <= 1,000,000. This problem is interesting
                because of the solution I found. In the beginning I was a little stuck, unsure how I'd be able to just ignore repeat possibilities. I
                then started to draw it out and noticed that all you need to do is calculate the summation of Eulter Totients (Phi n) from 2 <= n <= 1,000,000.
            </p>

            <h3> Project Euler #96: Sudoku</h3>
            <img src="assets/Sudoku.png" srcset="assets/Sudoku.png 1200w, assets/S900W.png 900w, assets/S600W.png 600w">
            <p>
                This problem covers solving for unsolved Sudoku puzzles and then calculating the summation of the top three digits of each puzzle as 
                a number. This problem was very interesting to me because I ended having to use an algorithm to solve it. A backtracking algorithm, to
                be precise. Algorithms are interesting to me, I like optimal solutions.
